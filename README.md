# SBideo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Seitenbau/SBideo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Seitenbau/SBideo) [![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/Seitenbau/SBideo.svg)](https://david-dm.org/Seitenbau/SBideo)

**DEMO**: https://seitenbau.github.io/SBideo/

A very simplistic video archive including video transcoding and following features:

- web interface for listing all videos in a flexible multi-level folder structure
- video player
- editable metadata for videos and folders e.g. title, description, speaker, tags ([in development](https://github.com/Seitenbau/SBideo/pull/19))
- ultra fast client-side fuzzy search through video metadata
- async video transcoding from any ffmpeg supported format to mp4
- simple file system based data structure, no database required
- integrated web- and pseudo-streaming server (express)
- very lightweight client-side code: total 28kb JS + 6kb CSS gzipped (based on [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli))

## CLI Commands

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn dev

# build for production with minification
yarn build

# test the production build locally
yarn serve

# run tests with jest and preact-render-spy
yarn test

# code linting
yarn lint
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [CLI Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).


## Basic usage

You can use the `data` folder in this repo as a reference for your directory layout. You can serve any folder having a structure like `data` by altering the parameter of `server.js`.

## Uploading and transcoding files
For video transcoding you also need a working [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) installation.

In addition to the server, run

```sh
node transcode.js ./incoming ./data
```

Every time you add video files into the folder `incoming`, the transcoding will start automatically. After transcoding is done, the new videos will be visible in the frontend.


## Migrate script
In case you want to migrate an old file based video archive, check the branch [migrateScript](https://github.com/Seitenbau/SBideo/tree/migrateScript); maybe it helps.
